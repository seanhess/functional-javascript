> "Pure" functions return a result based only on what you pass in. You never have to worry it is going to do something unexpected. Higher order functions (functions that take other functions as parameters) let us reuse code in places we wouldn't expect, like loops. Composition allows you to create larger tools from smaller ones.

After having wandered the Functional JS wastes for a few years, I will tell you stories of the dangers that lurk, as well as the rewards that await you if you apply Functional JS wisely.

What is Functional Programming?
-------------------------------

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.
— Wikipedia

Wait, What?

The alternative: Imperative Programming
------------------------------------
Series of instructions to the computer to access & modify memory. 

```
// I understand how every line of this works!
var totalAge = 0
for (var i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    totalAge += users[i].age
}
```

Functional Programming
----------------------
Functions as high-level tools you combine to do something. Math!

```
// don't know how this works, but it's clear what it does
var totalAge = users.map(userAge).reduce(sum)
```

Why functional programming?
---------------------------
*What* instead of *How*

Guarantees mean we can make nifty assumptions. Easier maintenance.

More code is reusable. Toolbox to Workshop

More expressive. Orders of magnitude smaller. 

Tradeoffs: Bigger Vocabulary

Tradeoffs: New Concepts
-----------------------

Concepts: Pure Functions
-------------------------

> Elevate the pure functions from the impure, lest they drag your whole codebase into the mire. — Saint Curry (not the spice)

[Pure functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) return the same result given the same arguments. Calling them does not cause side effects like mutation or IO.

### Example: Isaac Netwon

<img height="300" src="http://jp4.r0tt.com/l_a86fdef0-8582-11e1-94c2-357a50100004.jpg">

```
class Apple {
    constructor(gravity) {
        this.y = 0
        this.gravity = -9.8
        this.velocity = 0
    }

    // fall depends on this.gravity, and this.y, which can change. 
    // this is the right equation, I think...
    // what happens if I call this twice?
    fall(dt) {
        this.y += this.gravity * dt
    }
}
```

Separate out the pure calculation:

```
// look at this nice function I found on NPM!
// I guess my function was totally wrong
function doPhysics(a, v0, dt) {
    return v0*dt + (a*dt^2)/2
}

var distance = doPhysics(apple.gravity, apple.velocity, dt)

apple.y += distance

```

### Pure: Referential Transparency

The output is ONLY a function of the inputs. Swap it out.

- Optimizations - concurrency, memoization
- Easier to test and refactor
- Encourages reuse - independent of any classes (`Apple` vs `fall` vs `doPhysics`)

### Pure: No Side Effects

It doesn't mess anything else up. It won't change your arguments, global state, or the file system.

- Safe and Predictable - less brain space

### Separate the Pure from the rest

You still need IO and have state. Find the pure calculations and keep them separate

Concepts: Higher Order Functions
--------------------------------

<img width="400" src="http://imgur.com/0OlEYNd.png">

Higher Order Functions take a function as a parameter, or return a function. They let us reuse code in places we wouldn't expect, like loops.

### Example: Older is better

```
var bestProgrammer;
for (var i = 0; i < programmers.length; i++) {
    if (!bestProgrammer || programmers[i].age > bestProgrammer.age) {
        bestProgrammer = programmers[i]
    }
}
```

What is reusable about the above? Everything but `.age`.

```
function maximum(items, toValue) {
    var maxItem
    for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        if (!maxItem || toValue(items[i]) > toValue(maxItem)) {
            maxItem = items[i]
        }
    }
    return maxItem
}
```

The above belongs in an NPM module, and is no longer a part of our code base. POOF!

```
bestProgrammer = maximum(programmers, function(person) {
    return person.age
})

// ES6 version
bestProgrammer = maximum(programmers, (person) => person.age) 
```

This is much easier to read. `Maximum` is most likely maintained by someone else in the community and becomes well-tested. We can forget about how it works. 

See [lodash.com](lodash.com) for many common higher order functions.

Concepts: Composition
---------------------

> "I like tiny programs that do one thing well and one thing only. Which hypothetical reusable modules would make the task at hand trivial?" — substack

Build very focused tools, then use them to do something bigger. Here's our `totalAge` code from before. 

```
// Yay, I understand how every line of this works!
var totalAge = 0
for (var i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    totalAge += users[i].age
}
```

First we need some new tools. 

[`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) converts each item in an array to something else:

```
[1,2,3].map(function(n) { 
    return n*2 
})
// -> [2,4,6]
```

[`Array.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) aggregates data from an array into a single value

```
[1,2,3].reduce(function(total, n) {
    return total + n
}, 0)
// -> 6
```

Let's make a `sum` function, which does the same thing as `+`. as well as a function that gives the users' age

```
function sum(a, b) { return a + b }
function getAge(object) { return object.age }
```

That's 4 new tools in our toolbox: `map`, `reduce`, `sum`, and `getAge`. With all 4 of these, our original code becomes trivial.

```
// don't know HOW this works, but it's clear WHAT it does
var totalAge = users.map(getAge).reduce(sum)
```

Our composed application code is very unlikely to be buggy. Any bugs are probably in the individual functions, most of which come from well-tested 3rd party libraries. 

Principles

- do one thing, do it well
- most basic parameter possible
- someone already wrote it

## Instead of Inheritance

Example: Front-end components

Composition-Driven Development
------------------------------

Start writing the application code as if the functions exist. Start with *What*. Go back and write the new tools you need later.

```
function solveWorldHunger(population) {

    // hmm, this seems hard, but if I break it down...

    var food = getSoylent(population * MUCHO)
    var shipping = efficientDistribution(food)
    var economy = fixWorldEconomy(Time.MaybeTomorrow)
    return combine(shipping, economy)
}
```

### Application Agnostic

What is reusable about your code but not specific to your application? Write it and be famous. Oh wait, someone already did.

### Recompose to override things

3rd party libraries: make your most important calculations available as focused functions! You can't anticipate everything!

A map through the functional JS wastes
--------------------------------------
Consider using lambdas for clarity.

```
[1,2,3].map((n) => sum(n, 2))  // more clear
[1,2,3].map(sum.bind(null, 2)) // way too noisy

var sumc = _.curry(sum)
[1,2,3].map(sumc(2))           // confusing if people don't know about curry
```

The `compose` function is not really worth the confusion. Just use lambdas.

```
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name
}

function excitedly(message) {
    return message+"!"
}

var welcome = _.compose(excitedly, greet)      // what type is welcome?
var welcome = (name) => excitedly(greet(name)) // easier to understand
welcome("Kuali")
```

Crazy recursive loops

```
function eatAndDisgest(array) {
    var item = array.pop()
    return item + eatAndDisgest(array) // the stack hates you
}
```

Use a type system! Compose

We all Win
----------

If we focus on composable code we can all build off each other's work. 

*What* instead of *How*. Smaller code bases. Refactoring. Maintenance

It's Over!
